# SKALE Demo Code Examples

SKALE is an open-source, fully decentralized, layer 2 scaling network. Nodes in the SKALE Network are placed into SKALE chains (S-chains) in a random, cryptographically secure manner. The nodes work together to run a fast, asynchronous consensus with fast finality. S-chains are capable of performing state updates by messaging each other and the main Ethereum chain using BLS threshold signatures. The result is a decentralized, cost-effective, secure, and easy to use layer 2 scaling environment.

# SKALE Examples

Deploying to SKALE is similar to deploying to the Ethereum blockchain. There are a few changes you will need to make within your existing deployment scripts. When using these code samples, please be sure to modify the code appropriately before running anything in production!
